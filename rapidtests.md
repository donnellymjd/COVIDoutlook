### At-Home Rapid Tests
It is unfortunately still too hard to get your hands on an inexpensive at-home rapid test in the United States. To make life easier for our readers, we have put together a list of links to some of the less expensive options for rapid tests. These test range from $7 - $10 per test. Many test kits sold at pharmacies range from $12 - $15 per test. 

COVIDoutlook encourages people to use at home rapid tests, but it is essential to use them regularly, especially when visiting with people at higher risk of severe COVID (elderly and immunocompromised.) 

Note: COVIDoutlook does not receive any compensation for these links and cannot independently vouch for the test quality.
